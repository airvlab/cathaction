The CathAction dataset encompasses approximately 500,000 annotated frames for catheterization action understanding task such as catheterization anticipation and action recognition.

These are five classes: advance catheter, retract catheter, advance guidewire, retract guidewire, and rotate. 

## Annotation Files Structure
The groundtruth CSV file containing 6 columns:

| `video_id`          | string                       | `video_1`         | Video the segment is in.                                                                                              |
| `start_frame`       | int                          | `430`          | Start frame of the action (WARNING only for frames extracted as detailed in [Video Information](#video-information)). |
| `stop_frame`        | int                          | `643`          | End frame of the action (WARNING only for frames  extracted as detailed in [Video Information](#video-info                                                        |
| `all_action_classes` | list of int    (1 or more)   | `[1]`           | List of numeric IDs corresponding to all of the parsed Action' classes.                             |

Please note we have included a python pickle file for ease of use. This includes a pandas dataframe with the same layout as above. This pickle file was created with pickle protocol 2 on Pandas version 0.22.0.
